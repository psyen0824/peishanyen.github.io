excerpt: 'The objective of the population and housing census is to collect the
demographic information of a nation or an area which is used for government
planning and policy making. However, the traditional census in recent years is
facing new challenges, such as the increase in survey cost, non-response rate,
and data demand. Although most countries still use the traditional census method
for 2010 census, many are seeking new methods to improve the quality of census
data and to reduce the survey cost.
The 2010 Taiwan Census will no longer use the traditional method and use
registered-based census with sampling survey instead. It will integrate the
official registry system to acquire the basic demographic characteristics, and
collect more detailed information on the social and economic topics, including
personal information about education, fertility, and elder care by using sampling
methods. The new method is adapting the experiences from Singapore,
Netherland, and the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden).
However, the new method should be evaluated carefully since Taiwan is
well-known for having some unique population characteristics....'

The objective of the population and housing census is to collect the
demographic information of a nation or an area which is used for government
planning and policy making. However, the traditional census in recent years is
facing new challenges, such as the increase in survey cost, non-response rate,
and data demand. Although most countries still use the traditional census method
for 2010 census, many are seeking new methods to improve the quality of census
data and to reduce the survey cost.
The 2010 Taiwan Census will no longer use the traditional method and use
registered-based census with sampling survey instead. It will integrate the
official registry system to acquire the basic demographic characteristics, and
collect more detailed information on the social and economic topics, including
personal information about education, fertility, and elder care by using sampling
methods. The new method is adapting the experiences from Singapore,
Netherland, and the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden).
However, the new method should be evaluated carefully since Taiwan is
well-known for having some unique population characteristics.
Thus, we will evaluate the new census methods from other countries and
see if they are suitable to use in Taiwan. We shall first introduce and compare the
traditional and new methods in conducting population census.. The new methods
include Registered-Based Census, Registered-Based Census with Sampling
Survey, and the Rolling Census. For the second half of paper, we will further
examine the survey methods that will be used for the U.S. and French census,
including the design concept and the sampling method executed by the American
Community Survey (ACS) to replace the long-form questionnaire for the 2010
U.S. Census. In addition, we will discuss the restrictions of using sampling
survey to collect data, and compare the traditional census to new census methods.
Finally, we will use examples to demonstrate the problems of using
registered-based population to estimate the De Jure (or permanent resident)
population in 2010 Taiwan Census.
