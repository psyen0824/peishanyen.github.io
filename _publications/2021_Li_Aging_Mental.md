### Method
This study utilized a retrospective cross-sectional study design. The dataset was obtained from 2015-2017 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).
Healthcare discrimination experience (yes, no) was measured using the following question “Over your entire lifetime, how often have you been treated unfairly 
when getting medical care (never, rarely, sometimes, often)?”. 
Psychological distress was the study outcome and was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. 
A composite score (0-24) was created for psychological distress for the prior 30 days and for the worse most in the past 12 months. 
A hierarchical multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine the influence of healthcare discrimination experience 
on psychological distress after adjusting for other covariates.

### Results
Study participants (weighted N = 1,360,487) had a mean age of 64.35 years (SD = 0.61), were primarily female (54.93%), heterosexual (96.61%), 
and married or living with a partner (73.37%). 
About 10.00% of older Asian Americans ever perceived healthcare discrimination over their entire lifetime. 
Perceived discrimination was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for the past 30 days (beta= 2.107, SE = 0.662, p < 0.05) 
and for the worst month in the past year (beta= 2.099, SE = 0.697, p < 0.05) after controlling for covariates.

### Conclusion
Self-reported discrimination was relatively low in this sample of older Asian American adults. 
However, consistent with prior research, perceived discrimination in the healthcare setting was associated with increased psychological distress. 
The findings have implications for improving the quality of health care services received.
