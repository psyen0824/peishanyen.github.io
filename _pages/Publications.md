### Objective
This study aimed to examine the influence of intimate partner violence on psychological distress among 
a diverse sample of older Asian Americans living in California. Methods: Participants in the 2007–2009 
California Health and Interview Survey (CHIS) aged fifty years and older and self-reported as Asian Americans were included in  the study. 
The primary independent variable was the history of  any intimate partner violence (physical or sexual violence) since 18 years of  age. 
The Kessler Psy-chological Distress Six-item Scale was used to measure the study dependent variable. 
A composite score (0–24) was created for psychological distress during the past 30 days as well as for the one month in the past 12 months 
when they were at their worst emotionally. Other covariates, including acculturation and demographic factors, were measured. 
Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions were conducted to examine the influence of intimate partner violence on psychological 
distress after adjusting for covariates. Results: In the study, about 8% of older Asian Americans reported ever experiencing intimate partner violence. 
After controlling for level of acculturation and demographic factors, a history of intimate partner violence was significantly associated 
with higher levels of psychological distress for the past month (beta =2.07, SE =0.74, p <0.05) and 
for the worst month in the past year (beta =1.99, SE =0.68, p <0.05). 

### Conclusion: 
Intimate partner violence is a significant risk factor for distress among older Asian Americans. 
Culturally targeted violence prevention efforts and treatment approaches for individuals impacted by violence are needed in this highly 
underserved segment of older Americans.

### Abstract
This study utilized a retrospective cross-sectional study design. The dataset was obtained from 2015-2017 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).
Healthcare discrimination experience (yes, no) was measured using the following question “Over your entire lifetime, how often have you been treated unfairly 
when getting medical care (never, rarely, sometimes, often)?”. 
Psychological distress was the study outcome and was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. 
A composite score (0-24) was created for psychological distress for the prior 30 days and for the worse most in the past 12 months. 
A hierarchical multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine the influence of healthcare discrimination experience 
on psychological distress after adjusting for other covariates...'


### Method

Psychological distress was the study outcome and was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. 
A composite score (0-24) was created for psychological distress for the prior 30 days and for the worse most in the past 12 months. 
A hierarchical multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine the influence of healthcare discrimination experience 
on psychological distress after adjusting for other covariates.

### Results
Study participants (weighted N = 1,360,487) had a mean age of 64.35 years (SD = 0.61), were primarily female (54.93%), heterosexual (96.61%), 
and married or living with a partner (73.37%). 
About 10.00% of older Asian Americans ever perceived healthcare discrimination over their entire lifetime. 
Perceived discrimination was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for the past 30 days (beta= 2.107, SE = 0.662, p < 0.05) 
and for the worst month in the past year (beta= 2.099, SE = 0.697, p < 0.05) after controlling for covariates.

# (2016) Big data: The data wisdom and knowledge-based economics
Jack C.S. Yue and Pei-Shan Yen, "Big data: The data wisdom and knowledge-based economics", <i>Tsang Hai Publishing, Taiwan</i>. 2016.

[Access the book](https://www.tsanghai.com.tw/book_detail.php?c=568&no=3659)



This book serves to address the principle ideas of big data from a statistical point of view. It begins with illustrating how to correctly define a problem, which is the core of big data analysis. Next, the book details the relation between big data and statistical sampling methods. Following this is the explanations of how to exercise various sampling techniques to collect big data. Then how to analyze big data systematically is addressed in detail. The last two chapters of this book provide some actual big data examples encountered by the authors.
