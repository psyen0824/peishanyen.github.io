Welcome! I am Pei-Shan Yen, a Ph.D. candidate majoring in Biostatistics at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). I have ~10 years of work experience in applied statistics specializing in data analysis, survey sampling, and marketing strategies. I also have a strong interest in the field of neuroimaging studies and biomedical research. 

As of now, I have published:
- One book (which discusses the fundamental knowledge of big data)
- Six journal papers (including two papers under review)
- Five conference proceedings

Also, I have given two talks pertaining to the application of statistical knowledge to some interesting research topics.
